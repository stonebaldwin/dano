## Start with a realistic payment target

Before shopping homes, estimate your monthly housing budget with taxes, insurance,
and HOA costs included.

## Gather documents early

Pre-approval is faster when you have income, asset, and ID documentation ready.

## Talk strategy with a local mortgage advisor

A local lender can help align your offer strategy with market conditions in
Wilmington neighborhoods.
